11. FAQ
Q1: Can I clone a VM?
A: Yes. Go to Compute → Virtual Machines → Clone. Select the source VM and desired configuration.

Q2: Can I attach multiple ISOs?
A: Yes, multiple ISOs can be attached for installation or recovery workflows.

Q3: Are AI models automatically versioned?
A: Yes. Each upload creates a new version entry under the model name. You can roll back or delete older versions.

Q4: Can I access the model API externally?
A: No. APIs are internal by default. External access requires admin approval and secure token exchange.

Q5: How are my models secured?
A: Oracle stores all models in encrypted object storage and restricts access via IAM roles.

Q6: Can I automate tasks like provisioning or backups?
A: Yes, Oracle provides REST APIs for automation. You can integrate with CI/CD or cron systems.

Q7: How do I request more resources?
A: Navigate to Admin → Resource Pools → Request Increase and specify the justification.

Q8: What if a model inference fails?
A: Check logs under AI → Models → Logs or contact AI support. Most issues are due to invalid input format.

Q9: Is there a CLI available?
A: Yes. Install `Oracle-cli` via pip or internal tools repository. Run `Oracle --help` for commands.

Q10: Can I migrate workloads between environments?
A: Yes, Oracle supports migration between Proxmox and Broadcom environments depending on configuration.
